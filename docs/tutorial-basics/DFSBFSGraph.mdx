## Depth-First Search (DFS) on Graphs

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm for traversing or searching through graph data structures. The algorithm starts at a given node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## How DFS Works

DFS can be implemented using either a recursive approach or an iterative approach with a stack. The key idea is to start from a source node, visit its adjacent nodes, and continue this process until all nodes reachable from the source are visited.

### Pseudocode

Here's the pseudocode for a recursive DFS on an undirected graph:

### Recusrive DFS 

```Javascript
const dfs = (graph, start, visited = new Set()) => {
  if (visited.has(start)) return

  console.log(start);
  visited.add(start)

  for (const neighbour of graph[start]) {
    if (!visited.has(neighbour)) {
      dfs(graph, neighbour, visited)
    }
  }
}
```

### Iterative DFS 

```Javascript
const dfsIterative = (graph, start, visited = new Set()) => {
  const stack = [start]
  visited.add(start)

  while (stack.length) {
    const current = stack.pop()
    console.log(current);
    for (const neighbour of graph[current]) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbour)) {
        stack.push(neighbour)
        visited.add(neighbour)
      }
    }

  }
}
```

# Breadth-First Search (BFS) on Graphs

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used for traversing or searching through graph or tree data structures. The algorithm starts at a given node and explores all of its neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## How BFS Works

BFS is typically implemented using a queue data structure. It starts from a source node and explores all of its neighbors first before moving on to the next layer of nodes. This ensures that nodes are visited in the order of their distance from the source node.

### Pseudocode

Hereâ€™s the pseudocode for BFS on an undirected graph:

### BFS 

```Javascript
const bfs = (graph, start, visited = new Set()) => {
  const queue = [start]
  visited.add(start)

  while (queue.length) {
    const current = queue.shift()
    console.log(current);
    for (const neighbour of graph[current]) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbour)) {
        queue.push(neighbour)
        visited.add(neighbour)
      }
    }

  }
}
```

```Javascript
const graph = {
  1: [2, 3],
  2: [1, 4],
  3: [1, 5],
  4: [2, 6],
  5: [3],
  6: [4]
};

dfs(graph, 1)
dfsIterative(graph,1)
bfs(graph, 1)
```
