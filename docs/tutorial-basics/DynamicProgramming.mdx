title: Dynamic Programming
---
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a technique used for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. It involves storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. There are two main approaches to implementing DP: **Top-Down** and **Bottom-Up**.

## Top-Down Approach (Memoization)

In the **Top-Down** approach, also known as **Memoization**, the problem is solved by recursively breaking it down into subproblems. Each subproblem's result is stored in a data structure (like an array or hash map) to avoid redundant calculations.

### Steps

1. **Recursive Definition**:
   - Define the problem recursively in terms of smaller subproblems.

2. **Memoization**:
   - Use a data structure (memoization table) to store the results of subproblems.

3. **Recursion**:
   - Solve the problem by making recursive calls and using the memoized results.

### Example: Fibonacci Numbers

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}

// Example usage
console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
```

## Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)
In the **Bottom-Up approach**, also known as Tabulation, the problem is solved by iteratively building up solutions to subproblems starting from the smallest subproblems. Results are stored in a table to build up the final solution.

## Steps
## Initialization

1. Initialize a table to store solutions to subproblems.
Iteration:

2. Solve smaller subproblems iteratively and store their results in the table.
Build Solution:

3. Use the results of smaller subproblems to build up the solution to the larger problem.
Example: Fibonacci Numbers


```JavaScript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  const dp = new Array(n + 1);
  dp[0] = 0;
  dp[1] = 1;

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }

  return dp[n];
}

// Example usage
console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
```
