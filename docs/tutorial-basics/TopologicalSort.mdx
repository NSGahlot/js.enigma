# Topological Sort Tutorial

## Introduction

Topological Sort is an algorithm used to order the vertices of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in a linear sequence. In this sequence, for every directed edge \( uv \) from vertex \( u \) to vertex \( v \), \( u \) comes before \( v \). This sorting is useful in scenarios where you need to schedule tasks or resolve dependencies.

## Key Concepts

1. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: A graph with directed edges and no cycles.
2. **Topological Order**: A linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge \( uv \), vertex \( u \) comes before vertex \( v \).

## Algorithms for Topological Sort

### 1. Kahn's Algorithm

Kahn's Algorithm uses the concept of in-degrees (number of incoming edges) to determine the order of vertices. It is suitable for finding a topological sort using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS) Based Algorithm

The DFS-based algorithm uses a stack to store the vertices in the topological order. It is suitable for finding a topological sort using Depth-First Search (DFS).

## Kahn's Algorithm Implementation

Here’s a JavaScript implementation of Kahn’s Algorithm for Topological Sort:

```javascript
function topologicalSortKahn(graph) {
  const inDegree = new Array(graph.length).fill(0);
  const queue = [];
  const result = [];

  // Compute the in-degrees of all vertices
  for (let u = 0; u < graph.length; u++) {
    for (const v of graph[u]) {
      inDegree[v]++;
    }
  }

  // Add vertices with in-degree 0 to the queue
  for (let i = 0; i < inDegree.length; i++) {
    if (inDegree[i] === 0) {
      queue.push(i);
    }
  }

  // Process the vertices in the queue
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const u = queue.shift();
    result.push(u);

    for (const v of graph[u]) {
      inDegree[v]--;
      if (inDegree[v] === 0) {
        queue.push(v);
      }
    }
  }

  // Check for cycles (if result length != graph length)
  if (result.length !== graph.length) {
    throw new Error('The graph contains a cycle');
  }

  return result;
}

// Example Usage
const graph = [
  [1, 2], // 0 -> 1, 0 -> 2
  [2],    // 1 -> 2
  []      // 2
];

console.log(topologicalSortKahn(graph)); // Output: [0, 1, 2] or [0, 2, 1]
