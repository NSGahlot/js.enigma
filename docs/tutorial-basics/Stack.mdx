# Stack Pattern

## Introduction

Stacks are a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. Stacks are used in various algorithms and problems, such as parsing expressions, managing function calls, and backtracking.

## Key Operations

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
- **Peek**: View the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.

## Common Patterns

### 1. Balanced Parentheses

Stacks are often used to validate balanced parentheses in expressions. The basic idea is to push each opening parenthesis onto the stack and pop from the stack when a closing parenthesis is encountered. If the stack is empty at the end, the parentheses are balanced.

**Example Problem: [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)**

```javascript
function isValid(s) {
    const stack = [];
    const map = { ')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[' };

    for (let char of s) {
        if (map[char]) {
            if (stack.pop() !== map[char]) return false;
        } else {
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }
    return stack.length === 0;
}
```

## Introduction

A monotonic stack is a stack that maintains a specific order of its elements. It can be either monotonic increasing or monotonic decreasing, depending on the problem requirements. This type of stack is useful for solving problems involving ordered data efficiently.

## Key Concepts

- **Monotonic Increasing Stack**: Maintains elements in increasing order from top to bottom. Useful for finding the next smaller element.
- **Monotonic Decreasing Stack**: Maintains elements in decreasing order from top to bottom. Useful for finding the next greater element.


# Monotonic Stack Variations

Monotonic stacks are used to solve problems involving ordered data by maintaining a specific order of elements. The table below summarizes various monotonic stack types and their typical use cases.

## Explanation

- **Monotonic Increasing Stack**: This stack maintains elements in increasing order from top to bottom. It's useful for problems where you need to find the next smaller element or the maximum rectangle in a histogram.
  
- **Monotonic Decreasing Stack**: This stack maintains elements in decreasing order from top to bottom. It's helpful for problems where you need to find the next greater element or solve problems related to trapped water.


## Applications

### 1. Next Greater Element

**Problem**: Given an array of integers, find the next greater element for each element. If no such element exists, output -1.

**Solution**: Use a monotonic decreasing stack to track elements in decreasing order. Iterate through the array from left to right. For each element, pop from the stack until the top of the stack is greater than the current element. The top of the stack is the next greater element for the current element.

**Example Problem**: [Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)

```javascript
function nextGreaterElements(nums) {
    const stack = [];
    const result = Array(nums.length).fill(-1);

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length * 2; i++) {
        const num = nums[i % nums.length];
        while (stack.length && nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] < num) {
            result[stack.pop()] = num;
        }
        if (i < nums.length) stack.push(i);
    }

    return result;
}
```
