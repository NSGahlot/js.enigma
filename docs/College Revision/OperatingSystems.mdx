## 1. Deadlock

Deadlock is a situation in operating systems where two or more processes are blocked forever because they are waiting for each other to release resources.


Conditions for Deadlock:


**1. Mutual Exclusion:** At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode (i.e., only one process can use the resource at any given time).

**2. Hold and Wait:** A process is holding at least one resource and is waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other processes.

**3. No Preemption:** Resources cannot be preempted (taken away) from processes; they must be released voluntarily.

**4. Circular Wait:** A set of processes exists such that each process is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the set.

**Deadlock Prevention:**

  - **Avoiding Circular Wait:** One strategy is to impose a total order on all resources and require that processes request resources in an increasing order of enumeration.
  - **Preemptive Resource Allocation:** If a process is holding resources and cannot proceed, the system can preempt its resources and give them to other processes.


## 2. Virtual Memory

Virtual memory allows programs to execute without requiring all of their data to be loaded into physical memory at once. It uses a combination of physical memory (RAM) and disk storage to create the illusion of a large, contiguous block of memory.

### Components:

- **Page Table**: Maps virtual memory addresses to physical addresses.
- **Paging**: The memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages. When a process accesses a page not currently in memory, a page fault occurs, and the operating system must load the required page from disk.

### Page Replacement Algorithms:

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest period.
- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Replaces the oldest page in memory.

### Example:

If your program accesses memory addresses outside the current physical memory allocation, the OS will trigger a page fault and load the required pages into memory.


## 3. Semaphores

A semaphore is a synchronization tool used to manage access to shared resources in a concurrent system. It maintains a count that is used to signal whether a resource is available or not.

### Types of Semaphores:

- **Binary Semaphore (Mutex)**:
  - It has two values: `0` or `1`.
  - Often used for mutual exclusion to ensure that only one process can access a critical section at a time.

- **Counting Semaphore**:
  - It can take any non-negative integer value.
  - It is useful for managing a set of resources, such as managing access to a pool of database connections.

### Operations:

- **P (Proberen)**: Decreases the semaphore's value. If the value is less than 0, the process will block until the value is greater than or equal to 0.
- **V (Verhogen)**: Increases the semaphore’s value. If there are processes waiting on the semaphore, one of them is unblocked.

**Example Code (Binary Semaphore):**

```JavaScript
let semaphore = 1;  // Semaphore initialized to 1

function P() {
  if (semaphore > 0) {
    semaphore--;  // Enter critical section
  } else {
    console.log("Waiting...");
  }
}

function V() {
  semaphore++;  // Exit critical section
}
```
