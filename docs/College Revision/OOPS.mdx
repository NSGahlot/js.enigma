title: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
---
The four pillars of OOP are fundamental concepts, and here's a recap of each:

## Encapsulation:

   - Wrapping data and methods into a single unit called a class.
It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent accidental interference.
For example, using getter and setter methods to control access to the internal state.

**Benefits:**
  - Data Hiding: Restrict access to internal object states.
  - Control: Allows controlled access through getter and setter methods.

```JavaScript
class Person {

  #name
  #age

  constructor(name, age) {
    this.#name = name;
    this.#age = age;
  }

  // Getter method
  get name() {
    return this.#name;
  }

  // Setter method
  set name(newName) {
    this.#name = newName;
  }
}

const p = new Person('John', 30);
console.log(p.name);  // John
p.name = 'Mike';      // Changing name via setter
console.log(p.name);  // Mike
```

## Abstraction:

   - Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features.
It allows for simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties an object should have.
You might have been asked how to implement abstract classes or interfaces to hide unnecessary implementation details.

**Benefits:**
  - Hides complexity.
  - Reduces programming errors by exposing only what is necessary.

```JavaScript
// Abstract class
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Abstract method (without implementation)
  makeSound() {
    throw "This method must be implemented by subclass";
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log('Woof!');
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy');
dog.makeSound();  // Woof!
```

## Inheritance:

   - Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
You could have been asked about the difference between single inheritance and multiple inheritance, and how method overriding works in OOP.

```JavaScript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy');
dog.speak();  // Buddy barks.
```

## Polymorphism:

   - Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It also allows methods to have the same name but behave differently depending on the object calling them.
You might have been asked to explain method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass).

```JavaScript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Dog barks");
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.speak();  // Dog barks
```
**Example of Method Overloading (JavaScript doesnâ€™t support it directly):**

```JavaScript
class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    if (arguments.length === 1) {
      return a + a;
    }
    return a + b;
  }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
console.log(calc.add(5));  // 10 (overloaded behavior)
console.log(calc.add(5, 3));  // 8
```
